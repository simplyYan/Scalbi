## âš¡ How CTMFS works
CTMFS takes all the files from your server (which you must indicate) and creates a single network that can load your entire site faster in just one directory/slug.
For example, suppose you have 3 files, called: "home.html, login.html, about.html" in this case, you could create an instance in Go with Scalbi indicating these files and you could access them for example like this: "http://localhost:3030/#home", in the same way with "#login" and "#about".
This way, your website/server loads faster and in a more flexible and secure way.
